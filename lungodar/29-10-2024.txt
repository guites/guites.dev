no
holy shit, its been a long time. i'm so glad that smoking in general has taken a back seat in my thoughts, and I'm
able to focus on other, more positive things. Every weekend I meet my friends in the city, and most of them are avid
smokers, but I'm staying strong to my commitment.

On the 30th I'm going to a concert, gonna have me some beers, so I'm taking the good ol' nicotine gum along,
just to be safe, since I haven't chewed it in like two months.

Let's go!
