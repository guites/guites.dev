no
feeling pretty proud about this one. went to a concert so all the kids were
smoking their hearths out. Went in like 5minutes before the band. My mate
and I avoided the smoking area (yeah, obviously) but it was right in front of
the venue, so it was actually kind of tricky.

We went inside, I had a beer, rocked out, went outside, and wouldn't you
know, everyone was smoking.

So we popped a nicotine gum each and went on our ways :) crisis averted.

Actually me a long time acquaintance, who used to NOT smoke back when I was
smoking senselessly and... he was smoking. Damn. Actually gave me strenght to go
on (had another nicotine gum there).

All in all, I consider it a total success!
