no
had my first social gathering since I've quit. Took my nicotine gums with me and everything, but ended up just chewing
lots of regular chiclets. Stayed calm and didn't really though about it. It helped that I knew one of the guys
there was an ex-smoker, so I kinda felt accepted.
Actually had a glass of wine, but since I was dining it didn't really impact me. Yey for staying entertained
