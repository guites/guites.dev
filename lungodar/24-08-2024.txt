no
I was so excited to register my 25th day that I didn't realize this was actually my 27th day without fucking smokes lets gooooooooo!!!!
Writing this up at 00:01 because today I went to the hackerspace, and a lot of people smoke there, but thankfully the guys are going outside
to light up (or maybe it was because there was some workshops going on there today), but anyways I didn't smoke, didn't felt much anxious,
just a little shaky as I didn't eat lunch and had a bit too much coffee
