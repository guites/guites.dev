no
so turns out that smoking is really tied to other habits. let's say you always light up first thing in the morning. when you stop,
you're gonna stay in bed feeling like a fish out of water. So my thing was tying cigarettes to drinking beer. And my gf gave me a can of
heineken this afternoon so it's sitting awkwardly on the fridge. I'm not opening it anytime soon
