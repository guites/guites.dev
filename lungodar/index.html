        <p>This is a very anxious page where I track my life as a non smoker. There are skulls <sup>💀</sup> on days I've had a cigarette, and a sticker <sup>🚭</sup> on the ones I haven't.</p>
        <p>You can put your mouse on the recorded days to get a glimpse of how I was feeling that particular moment.</p>
        <p><strong>My last day as a smoker was 28/07/2024</strong>. Every cigarette from there on can be seen as a misstep =P.</p>
        <p>Let's fucking go!</p>

weirdly enough I didn&#x27;t get any cravings, but the perspective of having that much free time (its the weekend after all) made me feel a little helpless.

I was constantly cycling through being confident to having a sudden &quot;wow I am never smoking again. What is even the point of life&quot; moment and then making peace with myself again.
