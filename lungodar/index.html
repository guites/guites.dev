        <p>This is a very anxious page where I track my life as a non smoker. There are skulls <sup>💀</sup> on days I've had a cigarette, and a sticker <sup>🚭</sup> on the ones I haven't.</p>
        <p>You can put your mouse on the recorded days to get a glimpse of how I was feeling that particular moment.</p>
        <p><strong>My last day as a smoker was 28/07/2024</strong>. Every cigarette from there on can be seen as a misstep =P.</p>
        <p>Let's fucking go!</p>

weirdly enough I didn&#x27;t get any cravings, but the perspective of having that much free time (its the weekend after all) made me feel a little helpless.

I was constantly cycling through being confident to having a sudden &quot;wow I am never smoking again. What is even the point of life&quot; moment and then making peace with myself again.

            <span data-tooltip='yesterday was a weird day (im writing this from the 10th). I had this slog of a meeting that I had to participate at work, and that got me a bit nervous. Smoking was how I would deal with this, bathing myself in tar smoke to shield me from the dull blade of corporate conversation.

This time I wasn&#x27;t feeling particularly inclined giving in just for a meeting, so a kind of adrenalish rush took over me as I popped a nicotine gum and went for a run around the block. By the time I came back I was still shaking, but felt relieved that I resisted the urge.

How impossible it is to measure the amount of human thought spent pondering on defeatism, self improvement, vice?
