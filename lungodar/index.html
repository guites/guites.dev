        <p>This is a very anxious page where I track my life as a non smoker. There are skulls <sup>💀</sup> on days I've had a cigarette, and a sticker <sup>🚭</sup> on the ones I haven't.</p>
        <p>You can put your mouse on the recorded days to get a glimpse of how I was feeling that particular moment.</p>
        <p><strong>My last day as a smoker was 28/07/2024</strong>. Every cigarette from there on can be seen as a misstep =P.</p>
        <p>Let's fucking go!</p>

This time I wasn&#x27;t feeling particularly inclined giving in just for a meeting, so a kind of adrenalish rush took over me as I popped a nicotine gum and went for a run around the block. By the time I came back I was still shaking, but felt relieved that I resisted the urge.

We went inside, I had a beer, rocked out, went outside, and wouldn&#x27;t you
know, everyone was smoking.

So we popped a nicotine gum each and went on our ways :) crisis averted.

Actually me a long time acquaintance, who used to NOT smoke back when I was
smoking senselessly and... he was smoking. Damn. Actually gave me strenght to go
on (had another nicotine gum there).

All in all, I consider it a total success!

able to focus on other, more positive things. Every weekend I meet my friends in the city, and most of them are avid
smokers, but I&#x27;m staying strong to my commitment.

On the 30th I&#x27;m going to a concert, gonna have me some beers, so I&#x27;m taking the good ol&#x27; nicotine gum along,
just to be safe, since I haven&#x27;t chewed it in like two months.

Let&#x27;s go!

but they kept insisting. Something distracted me and when I came to my senses I had a half smoked cig in my hand.
Felt bad, but still seemed like I had it under control. I don&#x27;t think I ever finished that cigarette.
