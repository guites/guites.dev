no
yesterday was a weird day (im writing this from the 10th). I had this slog of a meeting that I had to participate at work, and that got me a bit nervous. Smoking was how I would deal with this, bathing myself in tar smoke to shield me from the dull blade of corporate conversation.

This time I wasn't feeling particularly inclined giving in just for a meeting, so a kind of adrenalish rush took over me as I popped a nicotine gum and went for a run around the block. By the time I came back I was still shaking, but felt relieved that I resisted the urge.
