no
wow that was a long day. might have thought about smoking every thirty minutes.

weirdly enough I didn't get any cravings, but the perspective of having that much free time (its the weekend after all) made me feel a little helpless.

I was constantly cycling through being confident to having a sudden "wow I am never smoking again. What is even the point of life" moment and then making peace with myself again.
