doing fine. actually went out and bought the nicotine gum during my lunch break, but didn't try it yet.

i'm afraid that getting a taste for it won't help me in the process of letting go ~psychologically

I'm not really in the mood for smoking anyways since I'm down bad with a cold and chugging lots of drugstore syrup
