no
had this weird dream were someone tried to convince me to smoke a cigarrete. I didn't wanted to
but they kept insisting. Something distracted me and when I came to my senses I had a half smoked cig in my hand.
Felt bad, but still seemed like I had it under control. I don't think I ever finished that cigarette.

(woke up feeling very relieved)
