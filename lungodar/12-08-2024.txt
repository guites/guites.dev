no
been thinking about all the people in my life that quit smoking. my two guiding stars were always my two uncles who smoked
up to their thirthies and then both quit around the same time. One was 31 I think and the other one 33. They are both
very healthy nowadays but I just can't imagine them going through this bucketload of self reflection and doubt.
How impossible it is to measure the amount of human thought spent pondering on defeatism, self improvement, vice?
