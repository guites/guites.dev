no
almost gave in and had a beer. Was out for a walk and went right past a brewery :'(
decided not to though. kept my streak for now. But I'm really starting to miss having a cold one. Might test the waters this sunday. It isn't fair that I have to give everything up at the same time, but it does seems to be the custom. Nicotine and alcohol do go hand in hand...
